Hi, I’m Tyrone — a backend developer with a passion for building clean, efficient systems that solve real-world problems.

I’m transitioning into tech after 10+ years of leadership in the sales world, where I honed my skills in problem-solving, communication, and analytics. Now, I’m focused on building scalable APIs, designing relational databases, and writing maintainable code using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and SQLite.

Currently working on personal projects that reflect real business needs, and constantly learning new tools to improve my craft.

**Tech Stack:**  
JavaScript | Node.js | Express | Sequelize | SQLite | Git | REST APIs | NoSQL databases

**Let’s connect!**  
I’m open to collaboration, feedback, or backend roles — feel free to reach out.
